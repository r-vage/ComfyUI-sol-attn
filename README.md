Sparse attention and memory patches for video diffusion in ComfyUI, built around NVIDIA's **Sol-Attn** Triton reference kernel. This continuation is developed and validated on **Linux Mint 22.3 with an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (Ada Lovelace, SM89, 16 GB VRAM)**. Ships a generic per-model Sol-Attn patch plus four MiniMax H3-specific nodes for copy-free attention, scheduled sparsity, exact modulation fusion, and feed-forward peak-memory reduction.

## Continuation and credits

Maintained by **[r-vage](https://github.com/r-vage)**. This project continues **Saganaki22's original ComfyUI-sol-attn integration** (Git author: `drbaph`) because the original GitHub repository and user account are no longer available. The preserved upstream history ends at **v0.6.2**; **v0.6.3** is the first version of this continuation, covering the compatibility repairs and Linux/SM89 validation described below. This is an independent continuation, not a claim that the original author transferred ownership or endorses these changes.

Credit remains with **Saganaki22 and the original contributors** for the ComfyUI integration, and **NVIDIA / NVlabs / the Sol-Attn authors** for the underlying attention method and Triton reference kernels. The Apache-2.0 license and existing attribution are retained. Original Windows/RTX 5090 benchmarks are preserved as historical upstream results; they are not measurements from the current Linux machine.

Repository: [r-vage/ComfyUI-sol-attn](https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI-sol-attn). The [original repository URL](https://github.com/Saganaki22/ComfyUI-sol-attn) is retained only for attribution and may return 404. Package metadata in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) lists the current maintainer and original author separately.

> Kernel provenance: `sol_kernel/` contains vendored NVIDIA source (Apache-2.0) with repository modifications. The strided Triton pointer path, residual-INT8 extensions, and historical Windows/SM120 support are retained. The current Linux/SM89 setup uses Triton, not an SM120 CuTe backend.

## ComfyUI compatibility and validation

Supported interface range: **0.30.1–0.37.0**. Native MiniMax H3 already exists in 0.30.0; 0.30.1 remains this repository's original tested baseline and support floor. Runtime dispatch checks capabilities, without version-number branches. Node IDs, input ordering/defaults, and output types are unchanged.

Masks and precision opt-outs use the captured attention backend. H3 conditioning protection requires a valid current-call layout; unavailable layouts use dense attention. Per-token modulation rows use the original eager block, and feed-forward chunking remains usable without Triton. See the [changelog](changelog.md) for the compatibility changes.

Validation coverage: CPU wrapper regressions and real release layout/eager-forward definitions passed against all **22 locally available tags from v0.30.1 through v0.37.0**. GPU regressions passed on an **RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (SM89)**, including real-block fusion/callbacks, eager tensor-row fallback, conditioning query rows versus dense attention, INT8 paths, and activation handoff. The **SM120-only pointer/TMA comparison was skipped**. Browser creation and workflow save/reload passed for all five nodes in classic and Nodes 2.0 on **ComfyUI 0.37.0 / frontend 1.53.6**, using an isolated multi-user backend plus Vite serving the installed frontend assets. Unbuilt frontend source was not tested. These checks do **not** establish full-generation quality or performance across every release/GPU; checkpoint generation and broader GPU validation remain pending.

Run CPU regressions without CUDA or Triton (PyTorch required):

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_compatibility.py -v
```

Set `COMFYUI_ROOT` to a local ComfyUI Git checkout with release tags to check interfaces, or to an installed source checkout for GPU integration:

```bash
COMFYUI_ROOT=/path/to/ComfyUI python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_release_interfaces.py -v
COMFYUI_ROOT=/path/to/ComfyUI python tests/test_optimizations.py -v
```

The optional `tests/test_workflow_browser.mjs` uses `COMFY_TEST_URL`, `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` (an existing module's absolute entry path), and optionally `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE`. Use isolated test-server storage; the harness creates a test user if none exists and changes that user's renderer setting.

## Why this repo

Historical measurements on an RTX 5090 (release matrix in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md), 2026-08-09; third-party comparison retained there as historical context):

- **1.38–1.65× Sage throughput in bf16** at 8K–65K; residual int8 reaches 1.73–1.97× and opt-in P·V int8 reaches 1.98–2.33×.
- **Best int8 accuracy** — our kernel quantizes only K's per-block *residual* and keeps the mean term exact in bf16: 0.008 relative L2 vs the exact path, ~3.6× closer than full-key int8 designs (0.029).
- **Zero-copy by design** — the kernel reads H3's fused qkv views directly; no contiguous copies, 1.3–2.7 GiB lower peak at long lengths.
- **Cross-validated math** — our bf16 path is bit-identical to kijai's independent implementation (0.000000), and SDPA-parity in all-exact mode (0.00097).
- **More than a kernel** — scheduled tau with graph preview, dense-step and dense-block gates, conditioning exact-KV sink, feed-forward chunking (−37% MLP peak), int8 q/k and P·V quantization, SM86–SM121 support, and honest per-call fallback.

## Features

- **Opt-in per-model patching** — only the model you wire through a node is affected; the rest of your graph is untouched.
- **Two Sol-Attn integration paths** — a generic hook-based node for any model, and a MiniMax H3 node that feeds the kernel strided views of the fused qkv projection with zero q/k/v copies, plus an exact-KV sink for H3's packed conditioning rows.
- **SM86 through SM121** — pointer kernels on SM86, SM89, and SM120; TMA descriptor kernels on SM90, SM100, and SM121. SM121 covers the DGX Spark.
- **Scheduled sparsity** — ramp `tau` across sampling (sparse early, dense late) with a plotted schedule preview.
- **Bit-exact H3 modulation fusion** — combines segmented AdaLN and gated residual elementwise work without changing eager BF16 output or the selected attention backend.
- **Feed-forward chunking** — caps MiniMax H3's MLP peak activation memory, bit-identical output.
- **Honest fallback** — any shape or GPU the kernel can't handle uses your normal attention backend and logs why; `strict` mode raises instead while validating a new environment.
- **No new dependencies** — torch and Triton only; matplotlib is used for the schedule plot when available.

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA GPU: **SM86, SM89, SM90, SM100, SM120, or SM121** — SM86/89/120 run the pointer forward kernels; SM90/100/121 run TMA. SM120 was tested and benchmarked by the original project on Windows; SM86 is community hardware smoke-tested on an RTX 3090ti, SM89 is community hardware smoke-tested on an RTX 4080 SUPER ([issue #2](https://github.com/Saganaki22/ComfyUI-sol-attn/issues/2)); and SM121 (DGX Spark) is community-tested. SM89 attention performance is also measured locally on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER; see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks). SM86 performance is not yet benchmarked here.
- PyTorch with CUDA, **bfloat16** support
- **Triton** with `triton.tools.tensor_descriptor` (TMA) — verified on 3.6.0
- ComfyUI **0.30.1–0.37.0** (capability-based compatibility; see validation below)
- For the MiniMax H3 nodes: a MiniMax H3 checkpoint, e.g. `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors` in `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/`
- matplotlib (optional — only for the tau schedule preview image)

## Installation

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/r-vage/ComfyUI-sol-attn.git
```

Restart ComfyUI after placing this continuation in `custom_nodes`. Use one copy of this node pack: it preserves the original node IDs for workflow compatibility. The existing CUDA-enabled PyTorch and compatible Triton environment is sufficient. `pyproject.toml` records the optional Linux attention dependency and optional matplotlib preview dependency; the feed-forward node remains usable without Triton.

## Current validation environment

```text
Linux Mint 22.3 (x86_64) · NVIDIA driver 595.91.07
RTX 4070 Ti SUPER · Ada Lovelace · SM89 · 16 GB VRAM
Python 3.12.10 · PyTorch 2.10.0+cu130 · Triton 3.6.0
ComfyUI 0.37.0 · frontend 1.53.6 · SageAttention 2.2.0
```

CPU interface checks span ComfyUI 0.30.1–0.37.0. The current machine passed GPU kernel and real-block regression tests and the attention microbenchmarks in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md). Full-checkpoint generation quality and end-to-end generation performance remain unvalidated here.

### Historical upstream environment

```text
RTX 5090 (SM120)  ·  torch 2.10.0+cu130  ·  Triton 3.6.0
Python 3.12.10    ·  ComfyUI 0.30.1      ·  Windows 11
MiniMax H3 (56 heads × 128, bf16, mask=None) — satisfies all kernel constraints
```

Historical community testing also covered **NVIDIA DGX Spark** (SM121, aarch64, CUDA 13.0, Triton 3.6.0) — see [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) for the DGX Spark numbers. Sol-Attn's speedup over SageAttention is higher there (1.48–1.92×) because the GB10's LPDDR5X unified memory is bandwidth-bound and Sol-Attn saves bandwidth.

Sol-Attn's runtime constraints: `head_dim` exactly 128, bf16, no attention mask, 4D q/k/v with contiguous or TMA-compatible strides. Anything else falls back and logs the reason once per cause.

## Pipeline order

Where each node sits in a MiniMax H3 workflow:

```text
UNETLoader → (LoRA / other model patches)
          → Patch Sage Attention (KJNodes, optional global fallback)
          → MiniMax H3 Memory Efficient Sage Attention Patch (KJNodes, optional H3 fallback)
          → MiniMax H3 Scheduled Sol Attention Patch   (or the Memory Efficient one)
          → MiniMax H3 Fused Modulation
          → MiniMax H3 Chunk FeedForward
          → EasyCache (optional, core node)
          → guider / sampler
```

- **The two H3 attention nodes are alternatives — never both.** The scheduled node is a superset of the memory-efficient one (set `tau_start = tau_end` to make them identical).
- **For all three attention patches, order is mandatory:** `Patch Sage Attention (KJNodes) → MiniMax H3 Memory Efficient Sage Attention Patch (KJNodes) → MiniMax H3 Sol patch (this repo)`. Our H3 wrapper captures the already-patched memory-efficient Sage forward and uses it for short sequences, gated steps, unsupported shapes, and non-strict kernel failures. Other attention calls use KJNodes' global Sage override. Putting the H3 Sage patch after Sol shadows Sol entirely.
- **The generic `SolAttentionPatch` is not a substitute for the MiniMax-specific Sol node in this stack.** KJNodes' MiniMax memory-efficient Sage patch replaces each H3 attention module's `forward` directly, bypassing the global attention override that the generic node uses.
- **Fused Modulation is attention-independent.** It can sit before or after the attention patches and dynamically calls whichever H3 attention/MLP object patches are installed. The order shown above is recommended for readability. KJNodes' separate `MiniMax H3 Low VRAM Attention` replaces the whole block forward and therefore does not stack with this node; the fusion leaves an already block-patched layer unchanged.
- For non-H3 models use the generic `SolAttentionPatch` instead: `UNETLoader → Sol-Attn → guider`.

## Nodes

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Sol-Attn (sparse attention)</strong> — generic per-model patch, <code>model_patches/attention</code></summary>

Routes any model's self-attention through Sol-Attn via ComfyUI's `optimized_attention_override` hook. Falls back to your existing attention override or ComfyUI's selected backend for anything the kernel can't handle.

```text
UNETLoader → Sol-Attn → BasicGuider
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | required | The model to patch. |
| `enabled` | BOOLEAN | `True` | Flip to `False` to A/B without rewiring. |
| `tau` | FLOAT | `1.3` | Routing threshold in standard deviations above the mean block score. Higher = more KV blocks take the approximate path = faster, lower fidelity. `1.0` is the Sol-Attn paper default; `1.3` is the tuned default here. |
| `min_tokens` | INT | `4096` | Use the normal backend below this sequence length. |
| `strict` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Raise kernel errors instead of falling back. Enable while validating a new GPU or Triton version. |
| `thresh_type` | COMBO | `diag` | `diag` (evaluated default) or `exact` — second-moment statistics for more precise routing at extra precompute cost. |
| `int8_qk` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Quantize q/k to int8 for the exact attention path. On Linux RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (SM89), measured 1.77–1.96× SageAttention throughput at 4K–65K tokens (`tau=1`, no sinks), with ~0.008 additional relative L2 error versus sparse Sol BF16. This excludes sparsification error versus dense attention. |
| `int8_pv` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Additionally quantize the P·V dot to int8 (per-token P, per-channel V). Requires `int8_qk`. Speed gains depend on the GPU and sequence length; see benchmarks. Additional error versus Sol bf16 is about 0.014 rel L2 (0.008 with int8_qk alone). This excludes the shared sparsification error versus dense attention. Opt-in. |

**Output:** `model` (`MODEL`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. MiniMax H3 Memory Efficient Sol Attention Patch</strong> — zero-copy H3 attention, <code>model_patches/attention</code></summary>

H3-specific alternative to the generic node. The generic node receives BHSD q/k/v from ComfyUI's attention hook and must make contiguous copies for the kernel; this node replaces the attention module's forward directly and feeds the kernel strided NHD views of the model's fused qkv projection — no q/k/v copies, same fused in-place RMSNorm+RoPE the stock model uses.

```text
UNETLoader → MiniMax H3 Memory Efficient Sol Attention Patch → BasicGuider
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | required | A MiniMax H3 model; anything else passes through unchanged with a warning. |
| `enabled` | BOOLEAN | `True` | Flip to `False` to A/B without rewiring. |
| `tau` | FLOAT | `1.3` | Same routing threshold as the generic node. |
| `min_tokens` | INT | `4096` | Use the stock attention forward below this packed sequence length. |
| `strict` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Raise kernel errors instead of falling back. |
| `thresh_type` | COMBO | `diag` | Same estimator choice as node 1. |
| `int8_qk` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Same int8 q/k toggle as node 1. |
| `int8_pv` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Same int8 P·V toggle as node 1. Requires `int8_qk`. |
| `sink_conditioning` | COMBO | `exact_kv` | Keep H3's packed text/conditioning/reference/audio KV blocks exact to protect conditioning. `exact_kv_and_rows` also runs those query rows dense. Missing or invalid layouts use the captured dense fallback. Cost depends on the GPU and layout; the historical ~3%/~20% figures were not remeasured on SM89. `off` disables the sink. |
| `dense_blocks` | STRING | empty | Transformer blocks to keep dense, e.g. `0-2,-1` for the first three and the last (negative counts from the end). First/last blocks are the most approximation-sensitive. Empty sparsifies all. |

Only the 50 main DiT blocks are patched; the token refiner and short sequences behave exactly as stock. It can follow a memory-efficient sage attention patch (e.g. KJNodes' MiniMax H3 one): applied **after** it, this node adopts the sage forward as its fallback, so gated and ineligible steps run mem-efficient sage while eligible steps run Sol-Attn. Applied **before** it, the sage patch shadows this node entirely — order matters.

**Output:** `model` (`MODEL`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. MiniMax H3 Scheduled Sol Attention Patch</strong> — tau ramp with graph preview, <code>model_patches/attention</code></summary>

Same zero-copy attention path as node 2, but `tau` ramps across sampling: sparse on the early high-noise steps where attention structure is loose, denser on the late steps where detail forms. The current step is tracked from the diffusion timestep, so the schedule adapts to any step count automatically.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | required | A MiniMax H3 model. |
| `enabled` | BOOLEAN | `True` | Flip to `False` to A/B without rewiring. |
| `tau_start` | FLOAT | `1.3` | tau on the first, highest-noise step. |
| `tau_end` | FLOAT | `0.8` | tau on the final, low-noise steps. |
| `curve` | COMBO | `linear` | `linear`, `cosine`, `sqrt`, `smoothstep`, `exponential`, or `step` (hard switch at the midpoint) — how tau interpolates between the two ends. |
| `min_tokens` | INT | `4096` | Use the stock attention forward below this packed sequence length. |
| `strict` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Raise kernel errors instead of falling back. |
| `dense_percent` | FLOAT | `0.0` | Keep the stock dense attention for this fraction of early sampling — the Sol-Attn paper's recipe is `0.2`. `0` disables the gate. |
| `thresh_type` | COMBO | `diag` | Same estimator choice as node 1. |
| `int8_qk` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Same int8 q/k toggle as node 1. |
| `int8_pv` | BOOLEAN | `False` | Same int8 P·V toggle as node 1. Requires `int8_qk`. |
| `sink_conditioning` | COMBO | `exact_kv` | Same conditioning-sink choice as node 2. |
| `dense_blocks` | STRING | empty | Same dense-block spec as node 2. |

**Outputs:** `model` (`MODEL`), `tau_graph` (`IMAGE`) — wire to a Preview Image node to see the schedule curve.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. MiniMax H3 Fused Modulation</strong> — bit-exact DiT elementwise fusion, <code>model_patches/optimization</code></summary>

Replaces H3's per-segment eager AdaLN scale/shift and gated residual updates with four Triton launches per block. The token-to-AdaLN-row lookup is built once per packed layout and shared by all 50 blocks. Intermediate BF16 rounding is reproduced explicitly; random tensors and a real ComfyUI `DiTBlock` matched eager output with `torch.equal`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | required | A MiniMax H3 model; anything else passes through unchanged. |
| `enabled` | BOOLEAN | `True` | Flip to `False` to A/B without rewiring. |

This node does not select or wrap attention. Global Sage, KJNodes' H3 memory-efficient Sage, local H3 Sol, and the chunked MLP are resolved dynamically and continue to compose in either patch order. An unknown whole-block `forward` patch is left untouched instead of being bypassed.

**Output:** `model` (`MODEL`)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. MiniMax H3 Chunk FeedForward</strong> — MLP peak-memory reduction, <code>model_patches/memory</code></summary>

Splits H3's token-local feed-forward over the packed sequence dimension while preserving ComfyUI's `linear_input_act` implementation inside each chunk. Independent of Sol-Attn — it works with any attention backend. Most effective on the INT8 ConvRot checkpoint, where the swiglu activation is fused into the INT8 quantizer and the `[tokens, 28672]` first projection dominates peak MLP memory; on a plain bf16 checkpoint the eager swiglu path holds extra intermediates and the saving is small.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | required | A MiniMax H3 model. |
| `enabled` | BOOLEAN | `True` | Flip to `False` to A/B without rewiring. |
| `chunks` | INT | `2` | More chunks reduce peak MLP activation memory further. |
| `min_tokens` | INT | `8192` | Keep the normal full-width MLP below this packed sequence length. |

Chunking is token-independent math and retains H3's INT8 ConvRot path, whose activation scales are row-wise; outputs were bit-identical in testing. Inputs requiring gradients use the original unchunked MLP.

The benefit scales linearly with the packed sequence: the intermediate is 56 KB per token, so the saving grows from ~238 MiB at 8K tokens to ~1.9 GiB at 65K (measured, ×2 chunks, int8 checkpoint). Below `min_tokens` the node does nothing at all — lower it if you want relief on short renders too, raise it if you only care about long ones.

**Output:** `model` (`MODEL`)

</details>

## Benchmarks

Cross-repo comparison table (kijai, KingGore, SageAttention, SDPA): [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

### RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (SM89), 2026-10-02

This repository already uses **Triton**. On the current GPU, the measured attention throughput relative to installed SageAttention 2.2.0 was **1.48–1.56× for BF16**, **1.77–1.96× for INT8 QK**, and **1.87–2.26× for INT8 QK+PV**, across 4K–65K tokens. Selected times in milliseconds per attention call:

| Tokens | SageAttention | Sol BF16 | Sol INT8 QK | Sol INT8 QK+PV |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8,192 | 10.03 | 6.45 | 5.30 | 4.96 |
| 32,768 | 138.44 | 88.86 | 70.74 | 62.48 |
| 65,536 | 542.52 | 347.42 | 277.65 | 240.13 |

H3-shaped random BF16 inputs (`B=1, H=56, D=128`), `tau=1.0`, no conditioning sinks; median of 20 after warmup in a second process. This is not the H3 node's default `tau=1.3`/conditioning-protection configuration. Full methodology, memory, error measurements, raw results and the reproducible script are in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md#rtx-4070-ti-super-local-run-2026-10-02).

Sol's sparsification changes the output: at 8K, relative L2 versus dense SDPA was **0.750** for sparse BF16, compared with **0.0031** in forced-all-exact mode. The ~0.008/~0.014 INT8 errors are additional differences versus sparse Sol BF16. These synthetic measurements do not establish visual quality or full-video speedups. Third-party Sol repositories were not retested on this GPU.

The older tables below are from the RTX 5090 environment under "Historical upstream environment". They are retained as historical measurements and should not be used as timings for other GPUs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Attention speed — Sol-Attn vs SageAttention vs PyTorch SDPA</strong></summary>

H3 width (B=1, H=56, D=128, bf16 inputs), random tensors, `tau=1.0`, median of 20 iterations after three warmups. These are the second-process numbers after autotune caching:

| tokens | PyTorch SDPA (ms) | SageAttention (ms) | Sol bf16 | residual int8_qk | int8_qk+pv |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8,192 | 23.97 | 3.93 | 2.84 | 2.27 | **1.98** |
| 16,384 | 94.85 | 14.68 | 9.57 | 8.10 | **7.05** |
| 32,768 | 378.41 | 58.09 | 35.72 | 30.06 | **25.91** |
| 65,536 | 1,516.16 | 229.63 | 139.28 | 116.64 | **98.46** |

- BF16 is 1.38–1.65× faster than Sage across the table. Residual `int8_qk` reaches 1.73–1.97× Sage throughput while remaining the default INT8 quality choice.
- `int8_qk+pv` is the fastest measured local path at 1.98–2.33× Sage throughput. It remains opt-in/default-off because relative L2 error versus bf16 rises from `0.00802` to `0.01396`.
- Below roughly 4K tokens Sage wins outright. `min_tokens` defaults to 4,096; raise it toward 8,192 if you want only the measured wins.
- SageAttention is the fair baseline. PyTorch SDPA is shown only because other Sol-Attn plugins quote it — at these sizes it does not use a competitive kernel path.
- Random Gaussian inputs are the worst case for Sol-Attn's content-dependent routing, so real prompts should meet or beat these ratios; repeated runs vary by a few percent.
- The generic node's q/k/v copies cost a further 0.2–2 ms per call depending on length ("Sol generic" in the test output).

Full-model context: one controlled pair (MiniMax H3, 15 s, 480×864, 20 steps, `res_multistep`, fixed seed, same input image) measured Sage 9.91 s/it → Sol 8.92 s/it (−10%) with the hook-based node.

<summary><strong>Peak VRAM — attention, generic copies vs strided views</strong></summary>

Peak activation memory above resident for one H3 attention call:

| tokens | generic path (MiB) | strided path (MiB) | saved (MiB) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8,192 | 452 | 116 | 336 |
| 16,384 | 903 | 231 | 672 |
| 32,768 | 1,806 | 462 | 1,344 |
| 65,536 | 3,612 | 924 | 2,688 |

The saving matches the three `[tokens, 7168]` bf16 contiguous copies the strided path avoids.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Peak VRAM — feed-forward chunking (real INT8 checkpoint)</strong></summary>

One real first-block MLP from `minimax_h3_fl2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors`, loaded through ComfyUI's normal diffusion-model loader. Same input for both paths, peak above resident after warmup, outputs verified equal with `torch.testing.assert_close`:

| Tokens | FFN full | FFN chunked ×2 | Saved MiB | Saved % |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8,192 | 644 MiB | 406 MiB | 238 MiB | 37.0% |
| 16,384 | 1,288 MiB | 812 MiB | 476 MiB | 37.0% |
| 32,768 | 2,576 MiB | 1,624 MiB | 952 MiB | 37.0% |
| 65,536 | 5,152 MiB | 3,248 MiB | 1,904 MiB | 37.0% |

Throughput was neutral in isolation (within noise, ±4%). These numbers are specific to the INT8 ConvRot path; see node 5's notes for the bf16 caveat.

On the environment under "Historical upstream environment":

- Strided-view kernel output is **bit-identical** to contiguous input (max abs diff 0), including at ragged sequence lengths (8,191 / 12,345 / 38,247 tokens).
- All-exact mode (`tau=-100`, validation only) matches PyTorch SDPA at relative L2 error `0.00097`.
- The full patched H3 attention module matches the stock forward at relative L2 error `0.00009`, consistent with bf16 accumulation differences.
- The shared SM86/SM89/SM120 pointer implementation is bit-identical to the TMA kernels when cross-checked by forced dispatch on SM120 (bf16 and int8_qk); sink-forced-exact mode matches dense output.
- Inline-Q residual-int8 matches the former materialized-Q path bit-for-bit for aligned/ragged lengths, conditioning sinks, dense query rows, and `int8_pv` on/off.
- Fused H3 modulation/gating matches eager BF16 output bit-for-bit with both BF16 and FP32 AdaLN tables, including a real ComfyUI `DiTBlock` integration test.
- Chunked ×2 MLP output matches the full MLP exactly (`assert_close`, rtol=atol=0).

## Pairing with EasyCache

ComfyUI ships core **EasyCache**/`LazyCache` nodes (`comfy_extras/nodes_easycache.py`) that skip whole model evaluations when the input hasn't changed much — the maintained equivalent of TeaCache, and it handles H3's dual audio/video outputs. It composes with every node here: EasyCache skips some steps entirely, while Sol-Attn and chunking make the remaining steps cheaper and smaller. Don't max both approximations at once — an aggressive `reuse_threshold` plus a high `tau` will show in the output. A/B with a fixed seed.

## Console output

```text
[Sol-Attn] patched (tau=1.30, min_tokens=4096, strict=False)
[Sol-Attn] active
[Sol-Attn] dense fallback: <reason>
[MiniMax H3 Sol] patched 50 attention blocks (tau=1.30, min_tokens=4096, strict=False)
[MiniMax H3 fusion] patched 50 of 50 blocks
[MiniMax H3 fusion] active (38247 tokens, 8 modulation segments)
[MiniMax H3 FFN] patched 62 MLPs (chunks=2, min_tokens=8192)
```

Each distinct fallback reason is logged once per run. Also note the compile tax: Triton autotunes with `key=["T"]`, so the **first run at any new token count pays a JIT sweep inside the sampling loop** — timings are cached to disk, so a given token count pays it only once ever, but change resolution or duration and you pay it again for the new size. Benchmark the second run.

## Caveats

- **Sol-Attn is approximate.** Output will not be bit-identical to dense attention; whether that shows in your content is your call — A/B it with `enabled`.
- **MiniMax H3 is not evaluated in the Sol-Attn paper.** H3 uses a joint packed sequence (text, conditioning, audio, video); the `sink_conditioning` option implements the paper's exact conditioning-K/V handling, but dense first-layer scheduling and the rest of the paper's more conservative recipe are not implemented.
- **The historical Windows/SM120 pointer path and SM121 enablement are inherited repository integrations.** NVIDIA's current Sol-Engine branch has an optional Linux CuTe backend for SM120 and a portable Triton fallback; this package retains its own Comfy-compatible strided, residual-int8 implementation. SM121 (DGX Spark) support originated in community PR #3.
- **The H3-specific nodes bypass ComfyUI's attention hook.** Other patches attached to `optimized_attention_override` do not run on blocks where Sol is active, and attention `transformer_options` patches are not applied on the Sol path.
- **Architecture paths are intentionally separate.** SM86, SM89, and SM120 use the pointer family; SM120 is validated and benchmarked on RTX 5090; SM89 is also measured on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER. SM86 is hardware smoke-tested on RTX 30-series but is not yet performance-benchmarked here. The shared SM86/SM89/SM120 implementation is additionally cross-checked by forced dispatch on SM120. SM90/100/121 remain TMA. Run with `strict=true` once on a new environment.
- NVIDIA's published ~2.0–2.3× figures are for Sol-Engine as a whole (CuTe kernels, NVFP4, block fusion, datacenter GPUs). This is the Triton reference kernel alone — a different thing entirely.
- The [KingGore Blackwell fork](https://github.com/KingGore/ComfyUI_sol-attn_Blackwell) was evaluated at H3 width: 4.334 ms for its `flex_attention` path vs 3.256 ms for this Triton reference at 8,192 tokens. It uses a hard block mask (unselected blocks are dropped, not approximated), so it is a different method, and its import-time repair that moves files inside the installed PyTorch package is intentionally excluded here.
